# Scope

[Include a detailed description of this Working Groupâ€™s Scope.  This Scope is important is it establishes the bounds of each contributor's and licensee's patent commitment. For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.]

# Project Charter - Super Advanced Meter
The SAM specification consortium aims to create a worldwide applicable meter and respective data gateway specification that focuses on basic metering functionality, country-specific functionality, third party functionality and integration capability for system operation applications. These standards and requirements should boost the development of the meter as a reliable virtual node in the energy grid, enabling the energy transition and supporting new business models. It is of high importance that users, who are being measured, have control over their own data. The meter design is capable of measuring electricity. It further is capable of interfacing with gas, water and heat meters; and communicating dynamic pricing and greenhouse gas emission data on premise. It further supports communication outside of the proximity, both for meteorological data as well as third party data communication. This limits the interface scope and any WAN (wide area network) service thereafter is excluded from the SAM scope.
A special focus is put on the gateway, which is the smart part and provides the functionality to connect to the respective meters and enable communication towards LAN and WAN as well as translation between them via current and future standards.

Current and future standards that are referred to are curently researched and will be subsequently linked to this project for reference.

To provide an optional structure within the working groups specification, please reference to [Design Principles](https://github.com/super-advanced-meter/SAMeter/blob/main/2.2_Design%20Principles.md).

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive. 

---------------
The following Working Groups represent the initial groups as defined by the founding group. New working groups can be added by the steering group on request.


# Working Group Use Cases
The WG Use-Cases aims to describe the usage for each energy (market) role. The initial draft of use-cases per role will be provided by respective companies.
Some use-cases will be redundant when described by the variuos roles from their respective perspective. Thereby, it is necessary that after concluding use-case descriptions from different roles to mutually approve a consolidated description.

* TSO
* DSO
* Admin, responsible for maintaining data gateway and keeping it operational.
* Customers of all types (residential, industrial, commercial, governmental), the one whose energy is measured. He/She/It is enabled to manage his/ her/ its data permissions and device permissions. I.e. setting which other party is allowed to receive his/ her/ its measurements and from which device that is measured through the meter. Furthermore, can the gateway store received information on energy reporting, energy saving measures or ecological benefits. 
* SW Third Parties, these can be Energy Service Companies, Energy Management Companies, Retailers/ Suppliers, Aggregators, DIY End-customers, Non-government organizations and academia, who want to deploy software onto the gateway.
* HW Third parties, which produce additional equipment that connects with the data gateway to provide further benefits, e.g. a home display or control relais/ device.
A use-case description consists of the participating market roles, a process and the necessary artefacts.

# Working Group Architecture
The WG Architecture aims to describe the necessary technical interoperability and design constraints.
* Translation Building Block (WAN/ LAN interoperability) - The SAM Gateway needs to be able to connect and translate between common and widely used communication protocols. Hence, a main design objective is to develop a translation module, which can be regularly updated to support new common communication protocols, while little change needs to be done to the software core.
* On Gateway/ Cloud access - The architecture of the SAM Gateway must support easy control at local settings. They should allow for direct as well as remote access with standard customer equipment (web-browser access).
* Service compatibility (interaction to WAN) - The scope of the SAM Gateway are no cloud services, but standard and transparent connectivity to enable access to cloud services must be ensured. Hence, a well-documented and maintained API(s) must be provided.
* Internal information model - In order to realize above mentioned artifacts, the internal information model should be capable to realize and maintain service compatibility, access and translation.
* Integral security architecture - A proper level of secure design can be realized by defining the security-related requirements for hardware and software. The required level depends on use-cases to be deployed, risk and effect analysis on those use-cases, risk-appetite, resilience in processes or at higher levels in the grid.
* Privacy and transparency - The privacy design of SAM will only give transparency to the users being measured, on how data privacy is guarenteed to them by the technical design.

# Scope

[Include a detailed description of this Working Groupâ€™s Scope.  This Scope is important is it establishes the bounds of each contributor's and licensee's patent commitment. For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.]


# Working Group Architecture
The WG Architecture aims to describe the necessary technical interoperability and design constraints.
* Translation Building Block (WAN/ LAN interoperability) - The SAM Gateway needs to be able to connect and translate between common and widely used communication protocols. Hence, a main design objective is to develop a translation module, which can be regularly updated to support new common communication protocols, while little change needs to be done to the software core.
* On Gateway/ Cloud access - The architecture of the SAM Gateway must support easy control at local settings. They should allow for direct as well as remote access with standard customer equipment (web-browser access).
* Service compatibility (interaction to WAN) - The scope of the SAM Gateway are no cloud services, but standard and transparent connectivity to enable access to cloud services must be ensured. Hence, a well-documented and maintained API(s) must be provided.
* Internal information model - In order to realize above mentioned artifacts, the internal information model should be capable to realize and maintain service compatibility, access and translation.
* Integral security architecture - A proper level of secure design can be realized by defining the security-related requirements for hardware and software. The required level depends on use-cases to be deployed, risk and effect analysis on those use-cases, risk-appetite, resilience in processes or at higher levels in the grid.
* Privacy and transparency - The privacy design of SAM will only give transparency to the users being measured, on how data privacy is guarenteed to them by the technical design.
